# q-demonstration

An interactive demonstration of a queue in C made in 2nd year. The queue is implemented as a linked list structure. The program can be run from the terminal using the following command:

```
$ gcc q-demo.c
$ ./a.out
```

A user specified name can be given to the output using the -o flag as standard:

```
$ gcc q-demo.c -o q-demo
$ ./q-demo
```

NOTE: the illustrate command is slightly buggy, especially when the queue contains only a couple of items.
